plan: 

1. data security

   1.1) use encryptor.py to encrypt a dir and all its children (used when you are going to take out a usb stick)


   1.2) use decryptor.py to decrypt a dir and all its children (used when inserting a usb stick)

3. identifying the culprit(in progress)

   2.1) set up bait file

   2.2) create hooks on some http server controlled by me

   2.3) send IP of device on network to some server as a form of http POST on port 80 (assuming that the device has an open port 80, and we have been granted access because the file is ran)
